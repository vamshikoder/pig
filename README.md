## What is this?

This application allows to manage college in an interactive way. You can do almost anything that is releated to college. Say, searching for books, getting your fees and accounts, mark attendance to students right from the app and so on.

## Why we are making this.

Educational Institutions are complex and complicated to arrange and organize. In large institutions, it is even distressing to organize. Many different aspects make the institute which requires much power to run all of these. These are mostly managed by the people and sometimes we cannot ensure that they served the purpose. Every Institution or organization is all about data that needs to be taken care of and needs to be transferred among people. Data refers to student information, lecturer details, notices, notes, information, and more all of these data when sent manually can cause a misinterpretation among people.

#### we use

[Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) for the application.
[Dart]() for the server side scripting.
